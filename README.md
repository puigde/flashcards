# flashcards
Once upon a time there was a Data Science student who did not like to study for memorization, in order to minimize the study time needed he developed a simple software to use the flashcard method for memorization in terminal.

Current version is extremely simple and took less than an hour to develop. The plan is to make a nice app in the future but I want to post the roots of inspo.

How to use (simple steps):
-> download flashcards.cc\
-> open your terminal and compile with: clang++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall flashcards.cc\
-> execute on terminal with: ./a.out\
-> select the path to your data txt file and press ENTER\
start learning :):)

NOTE: current data format supported is: label,answer,hint, 
check the PSD.txt file as an example in the repo.

NOTE: if having trouble with the filepath put the executable (a.out) file in the same folder as the data.txt file with your flashcards data and should work fine.
